# LSL Cloud Streaming Specification  

## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: MQTT Cloud Relay
The system SHALL relay LSL streams to cloud services using MQTT message broker while preserving timestamp synchronization.

#### Scenario: MQTT connection establishment
- **WHEN** user configures cloud streaming endpoint
- **THEN** the system establishes secure MQTT connection
- **AND** authenticates using provided credentials
- **AND** maintains persistent connection with automatic reconnection

#### Scenario: Stream data publication
- **WHEN** receiving LSL stream samples
- **THEN** the system publishes data to configured MQTT topics
- **AND** embeds original LSL timestamps in message payload
- **AND** includes clock synchronization metadata
- **AND** maintains message ordering per stream

### Requirement: Timestamp Preservation
The system SHALL preserve LSL timestamp precision and synchronization metadata during cloud transmission.

#### Scenario: Timestamp encoding
- **WHEN** publishing LSL data to cloud
- **THEN** the system encodes timestamps as high-precision strings
- **AND** includes LSL clock offset information
- **AND** adds transmission timestamp for latency calculation
- **AND** preserves microsecond-level precision

#### Scenario: Clock synchronization metadata
- **WHEN** transmitting stream data
- **THEN** the system includes LSL clock reference information
- **AND** provides offset values for drift correction
- **AND** enables timestamp reconstruction on cloud side
- **AND** supports multi-stream temporal alignment

### Requirement: Reliable Data Transmission
The system SHALL ensure reliable delivery of LSL data to cloud services with error handling and recovery.

#### Scenario: Connection failure recovery
- **WHEN** cloud connection is lost
- **THEN** the system attempts automatic reconnection
- **AND** buffers data during disconnection periods
- **AND** resumes transmission when connection restored
- **AND** logs connection status changes

#### Scenario: Message delivery confirmation
- **WHEN** publishing data to cloud
- **THEN** the system tracks message delivery status
- **AND** implements retry logic for failed transmissions
- **AND** provides delivery acknowledgment callbacks
- **AND** maintains throughput metrics

### Requirement: Multi-Stream Cloud Support
The system SHALL support simultaneous cloud streaming of multiple LSL streams with independent configuration.

#### Scenario: Independent stream routing
- **WHEN** multiple LSL streams are active
- **THEN** the system routes each stream to configured cloud endpoints
- **AND** maintains separate MQTT topics per stream
- **AND** applies stream-specific transformation rules
- **AND** provides per-stream monitoring statistics

#### Scenario: Stream priority management
- **WHEN** handling multiple concurrent streams
- **THEN** the system applies priority-based bandwidth allocation
- **AND** maintains critical streams during network congestion
- **AND** provides configurable quality-of-service settings
- **AND** implements backpressure handling mechanisms
