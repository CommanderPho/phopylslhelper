# Implement LSL Stream Tools

## Why
The project needs flexible visualization tools for pylsl streams and reliable cloud streaming capabilities to support real-time neuroscience research. Current solutions either lack flexibility (fixed visualization) or don't preserve LSL's critical timestamp synchronization when streaming to cloud services.

## What Changes
- **Implement flexible LSL visualization system** - Multiple display backends (MNE-LSL, custom PyQt5, web-based)
- **Create cloud streaming relay** - MQTT/WebSocket bridge with timestamp preservation
- **Add synchronization management** - LSL clock sync metadata handling
- **Build modular architecture** - Plugin system for visualization and streaming backends
- **Provide configuration system** - YAML-based setup for streams and cloud endpoints

## Impact

**Affected specs:**
- `lsl-visualization` (new capability)
- `lsl-cloud-streaming` (new capability)

**Affected code:**
- `src/visualization/` (new) - Visualization backends and display management
- `src/streaming/` (new) - Cloud relay and synchronization components
- `src/core/` (new) - LSL stream management and configuration
- `config/` (new) - YAML configuration files
- `tests/` (new) - Comprehensive test suite
- `requirements.txt` - Python dependencies
